## Hi there, I'm Manaaia ðŸ‘‹

### Who am I?
- :briefcase: I am a fullstack web developer specialized in Symfony and React. 
- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on building highly specialized tools for different clients at the [KNPLabs company](https://knplabs.com/en/).
- :sparkles: I try to produce the best quality code possible, so bring the reviews and tests.
- :mag: I have a special interest in design patterns. I am always curious to discover new ones and see how and why they came to existence because I like the "oh! That's smart! Let me try this" excitement it brings me.
- :mortar_board: Beside work I have personal projects which I use to try and experiment with technologies I am not familiar with or to improve my skills on some tools.
- :dart: My goal for this year is to bring some contribution to the community.
- âš¡ You still want to know more? Well then, here is a bunch of random information about me:
  -	:smirk_cat: I have a cat that likes to walk on my keyboard when he wants al,q;clezfdqsncmqld;lqfns w qs; (rhoo this cat!)
  -	:headphones: I work with Lofi or Metal in my ears depending on the mood
